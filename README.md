Just a Simple app by MVI Architecture, Use-cases and multi-module; tried to show why we should use multi-module.
there is no much talk to say about what i did since everything that used in this project has a least a sample in my github,
except multi-module.

**Point of using Multi Module:**
Developers can work on specified part of project without make other developers slow. 
Maintainability, so in other words all the files can be maintained in relative modules where it will be easier to find and
By splitting each module into proper layers, class dependencies will stay clean.
If we change a file, the modularised apps compile faster than the monolithic apps which this means BUILD SPEED.

### What tech and library has been used for this?
**Ktor(bye bye Retrofit)**  
**Sql-Delight(maybe bye bye Room?LOL)** 
**Jetpack-Compose(also bye bye XML)**
